# include/README.md 

This directory contains auto-generated C headers and sources produced from the CAN `.dbc` files in `networks/`.

## Important

- **Do not edit these files by hand**
- These files are generated by `tools/canbuild.py`
- The `.dbc` files are the **source of truth**

## Updating generated files

If you modify a `.dbc` file, you must update `include/`.

```bash
python tools/canbuild.py build --out include
git add include
git commit -m "Update generated CAN interface"
```
